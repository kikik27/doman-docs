# DOMAN Smart Contracts

On-chain scam reporting and community voting contracts for the **DOMAN** platform — a community-powered security engine for Base chain.

> DOMAN protects users from phishing sites, scam addresses, and risky smart contracts through community-driven reporting and automated detection.

## Contracts

| Contract | Description |
|---|---|
| [ScamReporter](/smart-contracts/scam-reporter) | Decentralized scam-report vote submission with anti-double-vote enforcement |

## On-chain / Off-chain Architecture

All report data lives off-chain (Supabase). The smart contract acts as an **integrity anchor** — it proves that a given `(reporter, reasonHash, isScam)` triple was witnessed by the chain at a specific block.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Client["Client Layer"]
        Dashboard["DOMAN Dashboard"]
        Extension["Browser Extension"]
    end

    subgraph Chain["On-chain (Base Sepolia)"]
        Contract["ScamReporter.sol"]
    end

    subgraph Offchain["Off-chain"]
        Supabase["Supabase<br/>(PostgreSQL)"]
        Indexer["Ponder Indexer"]
    end

    Dashboard -->|"submitVote()"| Contract
    Extension -->|"submitVote()"| Contract
    Dashboard -->|"Store full payload"| Supabase
    Contract -->|"ScamVoteSubmitted event"| Indexer
    Indexer -->|"Sync on-chain data"| Supabase
    Supabase -.->|"Verify keccak256<br/>matches reasonHash"| Contract
```

### Report Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend as DOMAN Frontend
    participant Contract as ScamReporter.sol
    participant Indexer as Ponder Indexer
    participant DB as Supabase

    User->>Frontend: Submit scam report
    Frontend->>Contract: submitVote(targetType, targetId, reasonHash, isScam)
    Contract->>Contract: Validate (no double vote, valid target)
    Contract-->>Frontend: Emit ScamVoteSubmitted
    Frontend->>DB: Store full reason payload
    Indexer->>Contract: Detect ScamVoteSubmitted event
    Indexer->>DB: Insert indexed vote + update user stats
    Note over DB: On-chain hash matches off-chain payload ✓
```

1. **User** submits a report via DOMAN Dashboard or Extension.
2. **Frontend** calls `submitVote()` on-chain and stores the full payload in Supabase.
3. **Indexer** (Ponder) listens for `ScamVoteSubmitted` events and syncs on-chain data with the database.
4. **Verification** — anyone can recompute `keccak256(offchainPayload)` and verify it matches `reasonHash` in the event log.
